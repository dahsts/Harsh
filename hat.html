   <p>Wrong Turn 2021 reveals the group went looking for an old Civil War fort, only for a rolling tree log to suddenly appear and crush Gary. The survivors become lost in the woods and suspect they're being stalked; soon Milla goes missing and Adam is caught in a trap. The major turning point is when the group finds Adam being carried off by mysterious figures in robes wearing animal skulls. Adam beats one to death in revenge for Milla's supposed death - only for Milla to suddenly reappear unharmed. The group is then captured one by one by The Foundation, while Milla is killed in a trap.

     <p>Wrong Turn then catches up with Scott, who hires a guide to lead him to find The Foundation. His guide is swiftly killed and Scott is captured, with Jen having shot him with an arrow. It turns out this was a ploy for her survival, and she later helps her father escape while killing several cult members who try to stop them. Darius - who has fully converted to the cult's way of life - refuses to escape with them. The story then jumps ahead again, with the now pregnant Jen back to her old life and working with her dad.<br>The finale sees Jen visit her stepmother, only to see Venable and Ruthie - a young girl Jen befriended in the camp - sitting at the table. Despite The Foundation's isolation from society, Venable does a nice job fitting in as a "new neighbor" and he requests Jen come back with him or he'll kill her family. Wrong Turn 2021 seems like it will end on a dark note as she leaves with him and enters an RV with several cult members, but as it drives away, it can be seen swerving and it crashes. Jen then kills the fleeing Venable before walking away hand in hand with Ruthie.</p>
